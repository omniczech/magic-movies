This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## What the hell even is this?

In 2020, Hasbro released the first Universes Beyond product, marking the first time that real humans would be shown on a larger scale in card art. I might not like the move, but it dose mean that there are now movies out there with some or part of their cast on magic cards that were not made for that specific movie. This just takes all the data and smashes it down to show which of these movies have the most actors you can assemble from various sources.
